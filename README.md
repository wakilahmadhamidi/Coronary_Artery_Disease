# Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Prediction Model

# Overview
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a leading cause of heart-related illnesses and mortality worldwide. Early detection and intervention play a crucial role in managing and preventing the progression of CAD. This project aims to provide a Machine Learning (ML) solution for the early prediction of CAD based on relevant health parameters.

# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assess the risk of Coronary Artery Disease in individuals based on specific health attributes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to enable early detection, allowing for timely medical intervention and lifestyle modifications.

# Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing information such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia. The dataset is carefully curated to ensure accuracy and relevance.

# Machine Learning Algorithms
The project employs various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, and others. The choice of algorithms aims to create a robust and accurate predictive model.

# How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app.py
python app.py

Enter the required health parameters when prompted, and the model will provide a prediction regarding the likelihood of Coronary Artery Disease.
Results

The model provides results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, offering a comprehensive evaluation of its performance. The project encourages collaboration and welcomes contributions to further improve the predictive capabilities of the model.
